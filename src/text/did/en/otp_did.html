<h1> The One-Time-Pad </h1>
<p>The one-time pad is famous as being the <i>only completely unbreakable cipher</i>. Assuming that the secret pad is randomly generated, not-reused (hence "one-time pad"), and not leaked, it is impossible to learn a single bit of the plaintext of a message from a ciphertext.</p>

<h3>Encryption and decryption with the One-Time Pad</h3>
<p>The theory behind the OTP is that the encryption key has at least the same length as the actual message (i.e. the plaintext) and consists of truely random numbers. Each letter of the plaintext undergoes XOR operation with one element from the OTP. This results in a ciphertext that has no relation with the plaintext when the key is unknown. At the receiving end, the same OTP is used to retrieve the original plaintext. For this to work, the following rules are mandatory:
<ul>
    <li>The OTP should consist of truely random characters (noise).</li>
    <li>The OTP (i.e. the key) should have the same length as the plaintext (or longer).</li>
    <li>Only two copies of the OTP should exist.</li>
    <li>The OTP should be used only once.</li>
    <li>Both copies of the OTP are destroyed immediately after use.</li>
</ul>
