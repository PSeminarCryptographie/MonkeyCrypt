<h1> The RSA procedure </h1>
<p><B>Imagine a padlock.</B> <br>
This is a kind of lock that locks when you click it (i.e it doesn't require a key) but requires the key to open the lock.

So, I can send these padlocks to all my friends who want to communicate with me.<br>
I will send them only the lock but will keep the key with me.</p>

<p>My friends can write me messages, put it in a box, lock it with my padlock (by clicking it) and send it to me, even over high risk networks.
If the box is intercepted, it's contents will not be compromised since I still have the key with me.</p>

<p>When the box reaches me, I can open my padlock with my key and read the contents.
This way, I can send padlocks (public keys) to people outside which they can use to lock boxes (encrypt messages) without being in danger of the contents being compromised as the padlock key (the private key) is always with me and never exchanged over the network.<br />
