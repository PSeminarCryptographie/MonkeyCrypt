<h1> Enigma - Gamechanger in the Second World War. </h1>

The Enigma machine was created for Germany by Arthur Scherbius in World War I. 
It is a cypher machine: a way of changing the letters of a message so that it appears to be scrambled letters (or, random letters).

Each time a letter is typed, it appears as another letter in the alphabet. 
The choices are not random. They are decided by a series of rotors which are set each day to a different starting set-up. 
Every press of a key turns the rotors to a new position.

German military messages done on the Enigma machine were first broken by the Polish Cipher Bureau, beginning in December 1932. 
Later, they designed mechanical devices for breaking Enigma cyphers. 
From 1938 more complexity was added to the Enigma machines, making decryption more difficult.
