<h1> Enigma - Gamechanger in the Second World War. </h1>

The Enigma machine was created for Germany by Arthur Scherbius in World War I.<br />
It is a cypher machine: a way of changing the letters of a message so that it appears to be scrambled letters (or, random letters).<br />

Each time a letter is typed, it appears as another letter in the alphabet.<br />
The choices are not random. They are decided by a series of rotors which are set each day to a different starting set-up.<br />
Every press of a key turns the rotors to a new position.<br />

German military messages done on the Enigma machine were first broken by the Polish Cipher Bureau, beginning in December 1932.<br />
Later, they designed mechanical devices for breaking Enigma cyphers.<br />
From 1938 more complexity was added to the Enigma machines, making decryption more difficult.<br />
