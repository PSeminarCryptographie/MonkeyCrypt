Habillobi!
I am Joachim. Joachim Ringelnatz. Well, actually my name is Hans BÃ¶tticher. But Ringelnatz sounds way funnier, don't you think? Do you know what sounds funny? If you append "bi" behind each vowel of a word. Try it!
Originally, the bi-language was part of a special German dialect. They did this to seperate their language from the Buttians. While the Buttjersprache has its own vocabulary and many rules, such as the bi language, as you have learned, is quite simple and sounds quite incomprehensible, if you speak it quickly!
The bi language is very similar to other game languages, e.g. the B language. A "b" is inserted behind each vowel, and the same vowel is inserted again. Dabas klibingt dabann sobo!
What do I have to do with the game language, you ask? Well, I did not invent them, but in my poem, "poem in bi language" was made famous. However, in some palce I didn't quite follow all the rules, because in poetry everything is allowed. Maybe you can find out where a fault is?
