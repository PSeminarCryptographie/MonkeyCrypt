        I am the Iulius Caesar, famous Roman landlord. You
        have certainly heard of me, after all, I have completely conquered
        Gauls - Well, with the exception of a village that does not
        cease to resist me, I admit it. But that
        is also unfair, they have a secret magic potion! But al</span><span
        style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;">so
        I
        got a secret weapon named after me: The
        Caesar Encryption. So I send&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><span

        has
        worked as follows:</span><br>

      Can you guess what the following secret text means?<br>

      Excellent! As you can see, with the Caesar encryption,
      a letter is always replaced with exactly one other.
      Process as monoalphabetic substitution. You can replace it
      by writing down the normal alphabet, and
      including a comma, with any
</span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><span
      style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"> Buchstaben&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><span
      style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;">and continues
      accordingly. This first
      letter is then the "key" of the secret.<br>
      Here is an example with the key D: [] []<br>
      [Possibly. small sample exercise encrypt with
      Key D]<br>

      This is a Caesar disk. The plaintext alphabet is outside
      (capital letters), the secret text alphabets are inside. You
      always see the key below the plain text "A".
      If you press the [or the] arrow[s], it changes
      the key.<br>
      [Possibly. Example exercise with any key]<br>
      Basteltipp: So you can even make a Caesar-disk: prints
      under [print] of the document [Caesar-disk]. Glue that
      sheet on a piece of cardboard and cut the two slices
      then carefully. Place the two slices on a cork
      and fasten them with a rifle in their center.
      The Caesar discs are finished! You always see the key
      below the plaintext "A". If you press the [or the]
      arrow[s], the key changes.<br>
