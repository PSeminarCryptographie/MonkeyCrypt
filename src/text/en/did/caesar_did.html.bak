        I am
        the Iulius Caesar, famous Roman landlord. You
        have certainly heard of me, after all, I conquered all
        Gauls - Well, with the exception of a village that does not
        cease to resist me, I admit it. But that
        is also unfair, they have a secret magic potion! But al</span><span
        style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;">so
        I
        got a secret weapon named after me:
        Caesar encryption. So I send&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><span
        style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;">my
        legion's&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><span
        style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;">secret news.</span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><span

      <span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;">This
      has
      worked as follows:</span><br>
    </div>
    <span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;">
      A -&gt; E<br>
      B -&gt; F<br>
      ...<br>
      Z -&gt; D</span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><br>
    <span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Can you guess what the following secret text means?<br>
      Cipher text:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hiv Jimrh peyivx mq Aeph<br>
      Plain text:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enemy lurks in the<br>
      <br>
      Excellent! As you can see, with the Caesar encryption,
      a letter is always replaced with exactly one other.That is why this
      process is known as monoalphabetic substitution. You can replace it
      by writing down the normal alphabet, and
      including a comma, with any</span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><span
      style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"> letters&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"></span><span
      style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;">and continues
      accordingly. This first
      letter is then the "key" of the secret.<br>
      Here is an example with the key D: [] []<br>
      [Possibly. small sample exercise encrypt with
      Key D]<br>
    </span><span style="font-family: Bitstream Charter;"><br>
      This is a Caesar disk. The plaintext alphabet is outside
      (uppercase), the secret text is inside. You
      always see the key below the plaintext "A".
      If you press the [or the] arrows, the key
      changes.<br>
      [Possibly. Example exercise with any key]<br>
      Basteltipp: So you can even make a Caesar slice: prints
      under [print] of the document [Caesar-disk]. Glue the
      sheet onto a piece of cardboard and then carefully cut out
      the two slices. Place the two slices on a cork
      and fasten them with a rifle in their center.
      The Caesar discs are finished! You always see the key
      below the plaintext "A". If you press the [or the]
      arrow[s], the key changes.<br>
