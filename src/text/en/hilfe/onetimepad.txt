One-time pad

The key of the one-time pad is a string of characters from the alphabet.

The key should be exactly as long as the input.
A random key in exactly this length can be generated.
Randomly generated keys are safer.

Characters that are not contained in the alphabet are not encrypted.

The one-time pad is a polyalphabetic substitution.
