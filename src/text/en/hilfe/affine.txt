Affine cipher

The affine cipher has two keys, a and b.
Both are a sign of the alphabet.

a should be coprime to the length of the alphabet.
A random coprime key can be generated.
All keys are coprime to an alphabet that has a prime number as its length.

Characters that are not contained in the alphabet are not encrypted.


The affine cipher is a monoalphabetic substitution.
