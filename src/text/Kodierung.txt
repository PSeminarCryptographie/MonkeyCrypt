Coding

Hi! I am Alice, an expert in secret communication. Most of the time, I am concerned with cryptology - the doctrine of secrecy. This is quite useful and fun! But the communication itself is as important as the secret. Therefore one should know as a cryptologist also a little about codings.

How do you communicate in everyday life? Normally, people exchange information verbally, in their respective language. In our case, this is German. All languages, however, have different forms. He knows oral and written forms. But you can also communicate with each other by computer. Earlier, light signals were also used for communication. The translating of messages these forms of communication is called coding.

You do not need a mathematical function for encoding, but rather a kind of dictionary. These dictionaries and further information on individual encodings can be found under the margin column. Examples of encodings are MORSE CODING, ASCII CODING, BINARY CODING, or ALPHABET INDEX CODING.
